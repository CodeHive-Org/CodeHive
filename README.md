:star2: **Introducing CodeHive :**

The First-ever platform on the Tron blockchain, revolutionizing the way developers showcase their coding skills and earn stellar rewards!:moneybag: A place where coding meets opportunity. Look no further! At Code Hive, we’re changing the way problems get solved. We provide a vibrant space where individuals and businesses can throw their toughest challenges at developers. It’s where creativity thrives, and solutions come to life.

:bow_and_arrow: **Motivation Behind Building CodeHive**

Recognizing a gap in the tech industry, we observed that while developers have numerous platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank to practice and solve code, none of them offered rewards for problem-solving or provided a space for companies or individuals to issue challenges. Thus, we set out to fill this void by creating Code Hive, a platform where developers are incentivized to solve challenges, and both businesses and individuals can issue their problems for resolution.

:v: Project Value/Use Cases:

Utilizing Code Hive in Colleges & Companies:

With our project, colleges can organize activities and challenges for students to solve, offering rewards to those who successfully tackle the challenges. Similarly, companies can host engaging activities for employees, fostering friendly competition and rewarding those who solve the problems they provide.

Research suggests that when developers or individuals are offered rewards upon completing or solving a problem, their performance and learning outcomes significantly improve.
